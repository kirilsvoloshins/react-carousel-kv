    <div style="text-align:left;">
      <span style="font-weight:600;"> It does support: </span>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML content (you are now looking at h1, h2, h3 and span);</li>
        <li>Swiping on mobile devices (you can try it using the browser dev tools);</li>
        <li>Changing slides by clicking on arrows (arrows disappear on the first and last pages - just like on Instagram!);</li>
        <li>Changing slides by entering the number of the slide (the human one, not the zero based one);</li>
        <li>Changing slides does have some simple animation (actually too simple - I mean, it is just a for loop);</li>
      <ul> 
    </div>`,

    <h3> It does support images too </h3>

    <h3>Yet another nice image!</h3>
