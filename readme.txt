========== Working principle of the Carousel component

========== How to view the Carousel demo on PC?
1. Copy the project folder to the PC
2. Open the directory react-carousel-kv/dist
3. Open the file index.html via the web browser

========== How to view the Carousel component demo on the mobile device?
1. Copy the project folder to the PC
2. Open the project folder in your editor of choice (for example, VSCode, but you can also open it in the terminal)
3. Run the terminal command npm run serve
4. This command will launch the Carousel demo development server on the port 3010. Find out the IPv4 address of the PC (for example, 10.11.12.13). To do it on Windows, open cmd, type ipconfig, press Enter.
5. Assuming your mobile device is in the same network with the PC (can usually be done by connecting both devices to the same WiFi), open the web browser on your mobile device and navigate to the link consisting of IPv4_Address:3010.
For example, if your PCs IP address is 10.11.12.13, you should open the link 10.11.12.13:3010
