## Working principle of the Carousel component
Every slide is a code in HTML. To make the carousel component work, just pass an array of HTML codes to the "slides" prop of the Carousel component.

## How to view the Carousel component demo?
1. Copy the project folder to the PC
1. Open the project folder in your editor of choice (for example, VSCode, but you can also open it in the terminal)
1. Run the ```npm install``` command to download all needed dependencies
1. Run the terminal command ```npm run serve```. This command will launch the Carousel demo development server on the port ```3010```, where you can view the app on PC.

If you want to view the app on a mobile device, then do these steps too
1. Find out the ```IPv4 address``` of the PC (for example, 10.11.12.13). To do it on Windows, open ```cmd```, type ```ipconfig```, press Enter.
1. Assuming your mobile device is in the same network with the PC (can usually be done by connecting both devices to the same WiFi), open the web browser on your mobile device and navigate to the link consisting of ```IPv4_Address:3010```.

For example, if your PCs IP address is 10.11.12.13, you should open the link 10.11.12.13:3010
